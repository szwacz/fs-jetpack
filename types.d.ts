// API has the same set of synchronous and asynchronous methods.
// All async methods are promise based (no callbacks).

// Commonly used naming convention in Node world is reversed in this library (no 'method' and 'methodSync' naming).
// Asynchronous methods are those with 'Async' suffix, all methods without 'Async' in the name are synchronous.
// Reason behind this is that it gives very nice look to blocking API. And promise-based, non-blocking code is verbose
// anyway, so one more word is not much of a difference.
